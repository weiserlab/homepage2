abstract: The past decade has seen significant increases in the deployment of
  wireless embedded systems. However, several challenges exist that may hinder,
  or even stop, this rapid growth. Among them, a significant power asymmetry
  among platform components is a major concern. In particular, the radio
  transmitters consume orders of magnitude more power than the remaining
  components. One promising approach to address this challenge is to design
  wireless transmitters based on the backscatter mechanism. This mechanism
  allows wireless transmissions to occur at a similar power budget to sensing
  and computation operations in wireless embedded systems. In this article, we
  discuss designing transmitters based on backscatter mechanism that achieve a
  large range with a low power consumption, and thus bridge the power asymmetry
  among the components of wireless embedded systems.
