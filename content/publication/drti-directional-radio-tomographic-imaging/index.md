  Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) enables device free localisation of people and
  objects in many challenging environments and situations. Its basic principle
  is to detect the changes in the statistics of radio signals due to the radio
  link obstruction by people or objects. However, the localisation accuracy of
  RTI suffers from complicated multipath propagation behaviours in radio links.
  We propose to use inexpensive and energy efficient electronically switched
  directional (ESD) antennas to improve the quality of radio link behaviour
  observations, and therefore, the localisation accuracy of RTI. We implement a
  directional RTI (dRTI) system to understand how directional antennas can be
  used to improve RTI localisation accuracy. We also study the impact of the
  choice of antenna directions on the localisation accuracy of dRTI and propose
  methods to effectively choose informative antenna directions to improve
  localisation accuracy while reducing overhead. Furthermore, we analyse radio
  link obstruction performance in both theory and simulation, as well as false
  positives and false negatives of the obstruction measurements to show the
  superiority of the directional communication for RTI. We evaluate the
  performance of dRTI in diverse indoor environments and show that dRTI
  significantly outperforms the existing RTI localisation methods based on
  omni-directional antennas.
