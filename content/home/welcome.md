<br> We are a curiosity driven group of engineers and researchers interested in Wireless, Embedded Intelligence, Sensing and Emerging Technologies **(WEISER)**. We are hosted at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). <br>

With hundreds of millions of Internet of Things devices deployed worldwide and their number projected to reach a trillion soon, the Internet of Things has become a crucial part of our lives and economy. Therefore, we cover a wide range of topics in our research and teaching to enable a vision of the ubiquitous Internet of Things. <br>
