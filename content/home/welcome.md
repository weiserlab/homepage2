<br> We are a curiosity driven group of engineers and researchers interested in Wireless, Embedded Intelligence, Sensing and Emerging Technologies **(WEISER)**. <br> 

With hundreds of millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed worldwide and their number projected to reach a trillion soon,  IoT has become a crucial part of our lives and economy. We cover broad scope of topics related to the IoT in our research and teaching activities. They encompass a spectrum of topics; Including projects that tackle issues that are fundamental to the  IoT device, to efforts that take a broader system and network perspective for deployment of IoT in the real world. <br> 

We build real systems and prototypes. Commonly, this involves working at intersection of computer science, electronics and communication.  As such, our work is highly interdisciplinary, and we enjoy collaborations with engineers, artists, scientists,  members of government and industry, and domain experts from other disciplines. We commonly publish our research findings at flagship venues of computer systems (Sensys, Mobicom, Mobisys, Hotnets, Ipsn, and GetMobile) <br>

The group has its genesis to  research projects at [Uppsala University, Sweden](http://uu.se) and [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), that were supported by ABB (through 2019 ABB Research Award), Swedish Innovation Agency (VINNOVA),  and Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapradet). We are currently supported through startup-grant from [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg). <br>
