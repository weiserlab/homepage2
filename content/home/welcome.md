<br> We are a curiosity driven group of engineers and researchers interested in Wireless, Embedded Intelligence, Sensing and Emerging Technologies **(WEISER)**. We are hosted at the National University of Singapore. <br>

With hundreds of millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed worldwide and their number projected to reach a trillion soon, IoT has become a crucial part of our lives and economy. Our research and teaching tackle issues at the IoT ecosystem's fundamental level (devices) to broader system and network issues. <br>
