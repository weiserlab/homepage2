<br> We are a curiosity driven group of engineers and researchers interested in Wireless, Embedded Intelligence, Sensing and Emerging Technologies **(WEISER)**. We are hosted at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). <br> 

With hundreds of millions of Internet of Things devices deployed worldwide and their number projected to reach a trillion soon, the Internet of Things has become a crucial part of our lives and economy. We cover various topics related to the Internet of Things in our research and teaching activities. They encompass a spectrum of topics, projects that tackle issues that are fundamental to the device, to projects that take a broader system and network perspective and eventually deploying of Internet of Things in the real world. <br> 

We strive to build systems and prototypes that address *real-world* challenges. Our work is highly interdisciplinary, and we enjoy collaborating and working with engineers, artists, scientists, government members and industry members from various domains and disciplines.<br>
